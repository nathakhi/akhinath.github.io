**Current Interest**  
Recently, I've developed a strong interest in digital health, which has led me to pursue a professional certification in Health Informatics at Ryerson University. I'm excited to combine my research expertise and technical skills to create data-driven solutions that address the challenges faced by the current healthcare system and improve patient outcome.
 
**Personal Attributes**  
Known as a problem-solver among friends, family, and colleagues, I frequently receive compliments for my innovative ideas, critical thinking, and communication skills. I love inspiring others to take action, whether it’s starting a new business, going back to school, or pursuing their dream careers. I thrive in team environments where I can learn from others, but I'm equally adept at working independently. I’m accustomed to fast-paced settings and excel at juggling multiple tasks within tight deadlines. I’m a quick learner who eagerly embraces new challenges and adopts new ideas, always upholding the highest standards of work ethics and integrity.

On a personal note, I’m fun-loving, humorous, and an explorer at heart. As a strong-willed person, my motto is simple: "Never give up on your dream!"
