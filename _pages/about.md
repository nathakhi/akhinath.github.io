**A Little Background**  
Hi, I am Akhi Nath. I was born and raised in Bangladesh where I completed my Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) and practiced as a physician for more than five years. After that, I moved to Canada in 2019 and currently pursuing my Master of Science in Health Services Management at Ryerson University. 

**Professional Competencies**  
I am a highly motivated and experienced healthcare professional with a strong drive to improve the access, quality, and efficiency of healthcare. Having practiced as a physician for a long time, I developed a strong interest to engage myself in healthcare research and health management as I strongly believe that there are innumerable scopes for research in healthcare that can lead to a more efficient healthcare system with better patient care. 

My curious and exploring nature motivates me to constantly ask questions and seek answers through navigating different sources like articles, scientific literature and conduct my own research to confirm it. Mastering the knowledge of different research methodologies has enabled me to conduct both qualitative and quantitative research (See My Projects). I am also an expert in writing highly academic and professional reports. I have led academic projects that received 90%+ grades.

**Technical Expertise**  
I am skilled at implementing several data analysis techniques and performing statistical modeling and tests on data from different sectors, especially healthcare data using a wide range of tools and technologies. 

- Data Science and Analytics: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Exploratory Factor Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Inferential Statistical Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization with Python, R, SPSS, AMOS
- Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Principal Component Analysis, Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, ML lib
- Database Technology: SQL, MS SQL Server
- Cloud Technology: Azure
- Other Data Analysis and Reporting tools: Power BI, Tableau
- Advanced Excel: VBA Macros, Vlookup, and index/match, What-If Analysis, Pivot Tables.
- Other Softwares:

    Qualitative Data Analysis- NVivo 12
    Reference Management Tool- Mendeley, Zotero

**Current Interest**  
I have grown a big interest in Digital Health in recent years which is why I am pursuing a professional certification in Health Informatics at Ryerson University. I am looking forward to integrating my knowledge and skills to contribute to the development of data-driven solutions that will address the challenges the current healthcare system is facing and improve patient health in the future.
 
**Personal Attributes**  
I am known as a problem-solver within my circle of friends, families, and colleagues! I also often receive compliments for generating unique ideas, critical thinking, and communication skills. I have persuaded people to take action, e.g., start a business, resume study, pursue a dream career. I enjoy working in team environments as it allows me to learn new things from others. I am also comfortable and competent to work on my own. I am experienced in working in fast-paced environments while managing multiple tasks within limited time frames. I am a very fast and persistent learner who is very passionate to learn new subjects, face new challenges, and adopt new ideas. Work ethics and integrity are most valuable to me as a professional.

On a more personal level, I am a fun-loving person, humorous, love to explore, and a strong family woman! My motto in life is “Never give up on your dream”.
