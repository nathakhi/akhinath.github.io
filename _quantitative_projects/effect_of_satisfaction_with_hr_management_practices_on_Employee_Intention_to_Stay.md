title: "Effect of Satisfaction with HR Management Practices on Employee‚Äôs Intention to Stay"
excerpt: "This study explores how employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM) practices impact their intention to stay within an organization. Using survey data from the retail sector, the research found that higher satisfaction with pay, work involvement, and learning opportunities significantly increased employees' intentions to stay with the same organization. These findings suggest that enhancing HRM practices can reduce employee turnover by addressing factors that contribute to job satisfaction.<br/>"

<b>Background:</b>  
Employee turnover is a major concern for employers globally and has been widely studied in organizational behavior. According to a 2020 report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, 2020), about 3.5 million employees left their organizations in January 2020, a 20% increase from July 2016. High turnover rates can negatively impact an organization's performance, productivity, and budget, which has led to extensive research on the factors influencing turnover (Oladunmoye, 2017; Singh & Loncar, 2010).

Many previous studies indicated that human resource management (HRM) practices such as employee development, performance management, and compensation significantly influence employee outcomes such as organizational commitment (Herrbach et al., 2009), employee motivation (Gould-Williams & Davies, 2005), employee turnover (Nie et al., 2017). The reason could be that well-implemented Human Resource practices encourage positive employee attitudes, behaviors, and performance (Wright et al.,1994; Boselie et al., 2005). However, while some HR practices are known to reduce turnover at the organizational level, it remains unclear if employees' perceptions of these practices at an individual level have similar influences on individual turnover intention (Allen et al., 2003). The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of employees‚Äô satisfaction with specific HRM practices (pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, satisfaction with learning opportunities) on their intention to remain with their organization.

<b>Methods:</b>  
A secondary dataset was used for this study. It was primarily collected through a survey by the Task Force on Industry Innovations (TFII) and the Employee Development Task Force (EDTF) committees of the Eastern Automobile Dealers Association (EADA). The dataset had responses from 675 employees: 295 service technicians and 380 sales employees. The sample consisted of 86.9% male and only 13.1% female. The average age of the respondents was 37.42 years (SD = 5.41) and the average job tenure with the current dealer was 3.50 years (SD = 1.37). More than half of the sample (56.5%) were in sales and only 7% had union membership. 46.5% were paid in the hourly pay system.

<b>MEASURES:</b>

<b>Pay Satisfaction:</b> 
Pay satisfaction was measured using four items. Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with their current salary compared to their efforts in jobs and other colleagues. A
sample item is ‚ÄúSatisfaction with the amount of pay I get for the amount of work I do.‚Äù The response was recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied).
Cronbach's alpha for this construct was 0.69.

<b>Satisfaction with Work Involvement:</b> 
This was measured using four items where participants indicated their level of satisfaction with how the management allows them to participate in decision making, the amount of influence they have in accomplishing a job, and on company policies. For example, ‚ÄúSatisfaction with my participation in decisions about how the work is performed‚Äù. The response was recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied). Cronbach's alpha for this construct was 0.83.

<b>Satisfaction with Learning Opportunities:</b> 
Four items were used to measure the construct. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they are satisfied with the opportunities the organization provides to improve their job-related skills, continuous learning, and training. It features items such as ‚ÄúSatisfaction with the training my dealership provides‚Äù. The response was recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied). Cronbach's alpha for this construct was 0.87.

<b>Staying Intention:</b> 
This was assessed with three items indicating their intention to stay or leave the dealership within the next six months or for an alternative opportunity. The items were scaled on
a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). However, while two items represented intention to leave, one item
was on their intention to stay- ‚ÄúI plan on staying at this dealership as long as there is a job for me.‚Äù The two items with the intention to leave were reverse-coded. Cronbach's alpha for this construct was 0.79.

<b>Control Variables:</b>
To obtain a more precise estimate of the relationship between employee satisfaction with HR practices and intention to stay, I also assessed five potential control variables: age (in years), gender (1 = male; 0 = female), job tenure (years with current dealer), satisfaction with coworkers, and satisfaction with supervisor. Satisfaction with co-workers and satisfaction with the supervisor was measured with four items for each construct assessing their perception about interpersonal relationships with their colleagues and immediate supervisor on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied). All these variables were controlled for their potential influence on the intention to stay as previously reported by studies (Oladunmoye, 2017; Schreurs, 2013; Williams et al., 2006).

<b>Data Analyses:</b></br>
The analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26. First, missing values for the variables were identified in the data. As the missing values were less than 5% for each of
the variables, no case was removed. Moreover, SPSS handles missing values while running analysis, for example, it uses pairwise deletion for the correlation test and listwise deletion for
the regression analyses. Second, the internal consistency of the scales for satisfaction with HR practices was assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha (all were >.68). Then, I computed six
mean variables from the respective items for each of the six constructs of employee satisfaction and intention to stay. After that, outliers and normality of the variables were checked. There was no outlier in the targeted variables and data was normally distributed except for the years with the current dealer which had three outliers being more than three standard deviations from the mean and positively skewing the data. After removing the outliers, descriptive analyses of the variables were conducted. After that, the correlation of the variables was calculated through Pearson correlation. Finally, to test the hypotheses, a hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. After entering the dependent variable (Intention to stay), control variables and predictor variables were entered in two steps. In the first step, the control variables: age, gender, job tenure, satisfaction with coworkers, and satisfaction with the supervisor were simultaneously entered. In the second step, the independent variables: pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, and satisfaction with learning opportunities were entered.

<b>Results:</b>  
Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, reliabilities, and correlations of the variables. As expected, the intention to stay was positively and significantly associated with pay
satisfaction (r = .16, p < 0.001), satisfaction with learning opportunities (r =.15, p < 0.001), and satisfaction with work involvement (r = .17, p < 0.001). Additionally, there were some other interesting significant correlations. All of the satisfaction variables were negatively and significantly related to the job tenure, especially pay satisfaction had the highest negative correlation with the job tenure (r = -.33, p < 0.001) indicating that satisfaction with pay decreases with the increase in the years with the current dealer. While age was negatively and significantly associated with satisfaction with work involvement (r = -.23, p < 0.001) and learning opportunities (r = -.16, p < 0.001), it was not associated with pay satisfaction. Gender did not have any significant relation with any variables except for a weaker correlation with satisfaction with the supervisor (r =.10, p = 0.01).

Table 2 shows the summary of the hierarchical regression results. Results indicate that Model 1 with all the control variables (age, gender, job tenure, satisfaction with coworkers,
satisfaction with supervisors) was insignificant and none of the variables had any significant effect on the intention to stay. Model 2 with the predictor variables (Pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, and satisfaction with learning opportunities) was found to be significant with an adjusted ùëÖ2 change of .07 which implies that the predictor variables can explain 7% variance in the intention to stay above and beyond the control variables. As expected, satisfaction with all three HRM practices (Pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, and satisfaction with learning opportunities) was significantly and positively associated with intention to stay when the influence of age, gender, job tenure, satisfaction with supervisor, and coworkers were statistically controlled. It was also found that pay satisfaction was the strongest predictor for staying intention (b = .20, SE = .05, t = 4.13, p < .001) followed by satisfaction with work involvement (b = .18, SE = .04, t = 4.04, p < .001). Although satisfaction with learning opportunities was found to be a relatively weaker predictor for staying intention it was still statistically significant (b = .12, SE = .04, t = 2.94, p = .003). Therefore, all the hypotheses are Supported.

<b>Discussion:</b>  
The main objective of this study was to examine whether satisfaction with certain HR practices (pay, work involvement, and learning opportunities) directly influence employees‚Äô
intention to stay with the organization. The findings of the study indicate that the perception of each of the practices has significant positive effects on the intention to stay among the employees which eventually supports the findings from previous studies. This could be explained by the previous proposition of Allen et al., (2003) that employees who perceive organizational HR practices as supportive are more likely to stay with the organization because HR practices serve as an indication to the employee about how much the organization supports and cares about them which in turn influence the overall withdrawal process (Hom & Griffeth, 1995; Wayne et al.,1997). From the results, we can see that higher pay satisfaction predicts higher intention to stay and this finding corroborates with the results from Singh and Loncar (2010) and Williams et al.(2006) and supports underlying theories. From the perspective of equity theory, employees' perception of fairness and justice in their pay creates a sense of equilibrium at the workplace which motivates the employees to practice positive workplace behaviors and attitudes (Memon et al., 2017). Additionally, as expected, employee satisfaction with the involvement in work activities are also significantly associated with their intention to stay with the company which bolsters the previous literature that claimed the same (Memon et al., 2017; Schreurs et al., 2013). It is theoretically suggested that people involved physically in work, alone or in groups, show emotional connections and these positive emotional connections are likely to impact their work-related attitudes and behavior (Memon et al., 2016; Rich et al., 2010). Finally, the findings that the satisfaction with learning opportunities provided by the organization positively influences the employee's intention not to leave is also consistent with Nouri and Parker (2013) who explained the relationship through a social exchange process where employees' perception of career growth opportunities within the company motivate them for increased work commitment and intention to stay in reciprocation.

<b>Conclusion: </b></br>
This study contributes to the understanding of the role of satisfaction with HR practices on the employees‚Äô withdrawal attitudes.  As the result implies, employee perceptions regarding HRM practices are pivotal to employees‚Äô intention to stay with the company. Therefore, employers should pay more attention to improving their HRM practices to meet the expectations of the employees. Additionally, the study identifies which practices companies should prioritize, for example, satisfaction with pay was the strongest predictor of intention to stay followed by satisfaction with the opportunity to take part in work-related activities. These findings will help the companies to develop better HRM policies.
