<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
Service quality and price fairness are deemed to be two important antecedents of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty which are two key strategic sources of sustainable performance for any company. The purpose of this study is twofold - to examine the effect of service quality and price fairness on customer loyalty through satisfaction and to understand the effect of two socio-demographic characteristics of customers on these relationships.

<b>METHODS:</b>  
Secondary data was collected from an open data repository that met the criteria to address the study objectives. Data consisted of 384 observations. After data screening and preparation, the validity and reliability of the constructs including five dimensions of service quality, price fairness, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty were assessed with Chronbach’s alpha and exploratory factor analysis. After that, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the attributes of each factor by assessing the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs with average variance extracted values and composite reliability. Three of the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in AMOS and four were tested with Andrew Hayes process macro in SPSS.

<b>RESULTS:</b>  
The results showed that service quality and price fairness significantly influence customer satisfaction and customer satisfaction significantly affects customer loyalty. Additionally, it was found that gender and customers’ occupation moderates the relationship between price fairness and customer satisfaction.

<b>IMPLICATION:</b>  
This study is expected to add to the current literature on customer satisfaction and loyalty as well as help hospitality managers to understand the factors significantly influencing customer loyalty and undertake appropriate strategies to retain customers.
