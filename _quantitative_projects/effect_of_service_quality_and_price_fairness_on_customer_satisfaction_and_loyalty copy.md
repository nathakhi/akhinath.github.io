title: "Effect of Service Quality and Price Fairness on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty: Moderating Role of Gender and Occupation"
excerpt: "This study investigates the impact of service quality and price fairness on customer loyalty through the mediating role of customer satisfaction. It also explores how socio-demographic factors, such as gender and occupation, influence these relationships. Using secondary data and various statistical analyses, the study confirms that both service quality and price fairness significantly affect customer satisfaction, which in turn impacts customer loyalty. The findings provide valuable insights for hospitality managers to develop strategies for enhancing customer loyalty.<br/>"

<b>Background:</b>  
Modern days businesses are competitive. To survive as an organization over the years one must face the competition, offer quality services and products, ensure fair pricing, focus on continuous improvements, ensure customer satisfaction, and build a loyal customer base. The interaction between these two core issues, service quality and customer satisfaction, has received its due importance as a strategic component (Bolton & Drew, 1991; Landrum, Prybutok, & Zhang, 2010). It has been well-recognized in the research community that service quality indeed influences customer satisfaction and triggers customer loyalty (Hodkinson & Kiel, 2003; Wong & Sohal, 2003). Similarly, price fairness has been coined as an important antecedent of customer satisfaction and loyalty and researchers argued that price fairness has an effect on customers’ reactions and it is strategically important for companies while making price-related decisions (Hassan et al., 2013; Sinha & Batra, 1999). For ensuring service quality, measuring service quality reliably is of paramount importance and on that front SERVQUAL has been reliably used by many researchers (Landrum et al., 2010) in the restaurant industry (Banwet & Datta, 1999), in the context of the service industry (Pitt, Watson, & Kavan, 1997), and even in the context of cultural studies (Donthu & Yoo, 1998). Hence, the multitude of uses of the SERVQUAL service quality measurement scale validates its use for further research in a similar direction. In a similar research direction, this study aims to investigate how price fairness and service quality relates to customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Three hypotheses were developed based on previous literature review:
<b>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</b>: Service quality positively affects customer satisfaction.
<b>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</b>: Price fairness positively affects customer satisfaction.
<b>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</b>: Customer satisfaction positively affects customer loyalty.

<b>Methods:</b>  
A secondary dataset was collected for this project from Mendeley Data which is an open data repository. According to the data description, data was collected as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted in several coffee shops in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2018 (Dhisasmito & Kumar, 2020). 

The final sample (N = 384) consisted of 159 male and 225 female customers. More than two-thirds of the participants were below the age of twenty-four (70.3%) whereas a small fraction of them (only 1%) were more than fifty-five years old. 59.1% of the participants were students and 71.1% had a bachelor’s degree. A majority of the participants indicated that they spend between Indonesian rupiah (IDR) 1,000,000 and 1,999,000 (25%), followed by between 2,000,000 and 2,999,000 (23.2%) monthly for food and beverages. Nearly two-thirds of the participants (64.8%) visited coffee shops 1-3 times a month. Table 1 shows the summary of
sample descriptive statistics.

<b>Data Analysis:</b>  
For data screening, preparation, and analysis IBM SPSS Statistics and AMOS version 26 were used. 

<b>Data Preparation:</b>  
First, missing values were screened. There were no missing values found in any of the variables. Second, the normality of the variables was assessed by calculating the skewness and kurtosis statistics and Q-Q plots for normality tests. For detecting outliers, Mahalanobis distance and its probability were also calculated. All the methods showed that there were no outliers and the variables were normally distributed. The assumptions of regression have been confirmed with residual plots. There was no multicollinearity among the main variables. 

<b>Validity and Reliability:</b>  
In the next phase, the reliability and validity of each construct were measured separately. Scale items were assessed by measuring the internal consistency coefficient Cronbach's alpha. Table 2 shows that the reliability of all the scales was acceptable as the value of Cronbach’s alpha was found to be higher than the acceptable threshold value of 0.70 (Nunnally,1978). Then, the construct validity was tested through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The results of EFA are compiled in Table 2. Decisions have been made by considering factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 as significant (Olson et al, 2005; Albadvi et al., 2007). From the table, it can be seen that all the items of a particular construct are highly loaded on the corresponding construct with a factor loading of greater than 0.5. However, two items of loyalty (L3 and L5) were eliminated because of lower extraction values (< 0.5). Hence, out of 32 scales, three scales were eliminated after checking for reliability and validity and the final analysis was conducted with the 29 remaining scales.

</p>

SERVQUAL dimensions were measured with confirmatory factor analysis of the five dimensions in IBM AMOS 26. All the scales representing the five dimensions of SERVQUAL were highly and significantly loaded on respective dimensions. After confirming the validity, the average of the corresponding scales under each dimension was calculated and used as new observed variables of service quality in the subsequent analysis (Hair et al., 1995, p. 391 as cited in Keramati et al., 2010).

In the last phase of analysis, dependence techniques of multivariate analysis were carried out using AMOS 26 to test the goodness of fit of the measurement model as well as the structural equation model. Then, regression estimates were examined to test three of the hypotheses (H1, H2, H3) and to determine the relative significance of independent variables in influencing the dependent variable.

<b>Results:</b>  
An assessment of the measurement model followed by the structural model was conducted. The structural regression model included service quality (measured at Tangibility, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy), price fairness (measured at PF1, PF2,
PF3, and PF4), customer satisfaction (measured at S1, S2, S3, S4, S5), and customer loyalty (measured at L1, L2, L4) as latent variables with their corresponding items as indicators. The schematic SEM model is shown in Figure 3.

</p>

Overall model fit was good as indicated by four absolute fit measures (Chi-square, RMR, RMSEA, and GFI), three incremental fit measures (TLI, CFI, NFI), and three parsimonious fit measures (AGFI, PNFI, Normed chi-square) (Hair et al., 2009).

</p>

After that, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the attributes of each factor by assessing the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs with average variance extracted values and composite reliability. The full model with structural equation modeling was assessed next. After assessing the overall model, the estimated coefficients of the constructs were examined. All of the path estimates were significant at a level of p <.001 and in the expected direction. Service quality significantly influences customer satisfaction (H1), as b = .44, SE = .06, p < .001. Price fairness also showed a significant impact on customer satisfaction (b = .34, SE = .06, p < .001) which supported H2. Finally, the significant path coefficient between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty supported H3 (b = .80, SE = .07, p < .001). Thus three of the seven hypotheses were supported by the SEM model. The path coefficients and their significance levels are shown in Figure 5.

<b>Discussion:</b>  
This study investigates the impact of service quality and perceived price fairness on customer satisfaction, customer satisfaction on customer loyalty. Thus, this study contributes to the SERVQUAL, price fairness, customer satisfaction, and loyalty literature. The findings of
this study will also have potential managerial implications for coffee industry operators in particular and dine-in restaurants in general. Consistent with the findings of research undertakings like Lassar et al. (2000), Ha & Jang (2010), and Ma et al., (2014), this study establishes that service quality has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. Similarly, this study illustrates that customer satisfaction positively relates to customer loyalty which is consistent with the findings of Teeroovengadum (2020), Ha & Jang (2010), Ma et al. (2014), and Cha & Borchgrevink (2019). Perceived price fairness was found to be a key antecedent and an immediate predictor of customer satisfaction, which is consistent with the findings of Hanaysha (2016), Ryu et al. (2012), Herrmann et al. (2007), and Hassan et al. (2013). Specifically, this study establishes that perceived price fairness has a positive effect on customer satisfaction. Ryu et al. (2012) and Cha & Borchgrevink (2019) additionally argued that perceived value is linked to its costs and this price or cost fairness relates positively to customer satisfaction.
As the focus of this study was on the factors affecting customer satisfaction and loyalty rather than SERVQUAL, the composite service quality was examined, rather than the five separate service quality dimensions. Thus, this approach can be considered as a limitation of the study which future studies might want to address. Overall, the findings of this study lay reasonable grounds for managerial implications for the coffee industry and dine-in restaurant operators as the service quality and price fairness positively and significantly predicted customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction positively predicted customer loyalty. The industry players who intend to build a loyal customer base can leverage these findings. They can aim to offer greater service quality and improve customers’ perceived price fairness by enacting appropriate policies. 

<b>Conclusion:</b>  
The study has some limitations. The survey was conducted at coffee shops in a particular location (Jakarta, Indonesia) and hence the result may not be generalizable to different geographic areas and industry sectors. Further research can be carried out in different settings with a mixture of urban and rural people in order to cover a broader consumer market. Another limitation of the study is that the data used for the main analysis consisted of self-reported responses to questionnaires on all measures which could lead to response bias.
Future research using different research designs, such as an experimental study design might help overcome this issue and provide strong support for the model. Finally, as it was a secondary dataset, we had a limited number of items and variables. The model might be further fortified
and extended by considering a few additional demographic characteristics (e.g., income, social class, culture/ethnicity, etc.). Despite the limitations, our study has been able to provide strong support for the customer loyalty model as well as add some new perspectives to it. The
findings can be useful for the industry operators when setting prices for their products and designing services to trigger perceived value creation in the psyche of potential customers.
