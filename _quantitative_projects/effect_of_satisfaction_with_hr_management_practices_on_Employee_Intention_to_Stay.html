title: "Effect of Satisfaction with HR Management Practices on Employee’s Intention to Stay"
excerpt: "This study explores how employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM) practices impact their intention to stay within an organization. Using survey data from the retail sector, the research found that higher satisfaction with pay, work involvement, and learning opportunities significantly increased employees' intentions to remain. These findings suggest that enhancing HRM practices can reduce employee turnover by addressing factors that contribute to job satisfaction.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
Growing concern over the increasing trend of employee turnover in organizations has attracted scholars to investigate and identify its significant predictors. This study examines whether employee perceptions of human resource management (HRM) practices influence their intention to stay with the organization. Based on the previous literature and established theories, I hypothesized that pay satisfaction, satisfaction with work involvement, and satisfaction with learning opportunities within the organization positively predict the intention to stay.
<br> <br/>

<b>METHODS:</b>  
A cross-sectional survey data in the retail sector with 672 data points were used. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses.
<br> <br/>

<b>RESULTS:</b>  
The results indicated that all three measures of HRM practices positively and significantly predicted the intention to stay. The study contributes to the understanding of the role of satisfaction with HRM practices on the employees’ withdrawal attitudes.
<br> <br/>

<b>IMPLICATION:</b>  
Practical implication includes drawing employers’ attention to improving their HRM policies and practices to meet the expectation of the employees in order to influence their turnover attitudes.
