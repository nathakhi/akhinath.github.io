<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
There has been a long-standing gap between research and its application in practice, and despite efforts to promote evidence-based practice, this gap still exists (Graham et al., 2006). Failure to use research evidence in decision-making contributes to under-prescribing or overprescribing behaviors among physicians. This gap not only prevents patients from receiving optimal care but also results in the inefficient use of the billions of dollars invested in healthcare research annually. Therefore, it is crucial to increase the use of research evidence to support evidence-based prescribing decisions. However, effectively utilizing evidence at the point of care requires more than just passively disseminating research findings; it also needs active effort from practitioners to seek out and apply this evidence when making decisions (Straus et al., 2009).
<p>
Given the ever-growing body of research evidence in healthcare and the increasing number of sources to access this information, it is unclear how physicians currently use these resources to obtain new evidence and incorporate it into their practice (Bengough et al., 2015). To improve the use of research evidence by physicians at the point of care, it is essential first to understand how they currently use new research findings to inform their decisions. This study aims to provide deeper insight into how physicians make evidence-based clinical decisions when prescribing new medications, specifically focusing on how they select information sources for new drug information and how they process this information clinically to apply it in practice.

<b>METHODS:</b>  
The study was designed with a qualitative research method using semi-structured, open-ended interviews. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Physicians with clinical experience in prescribing drugs were invited to participate in the study. Research Ethics Board approval was obtained from Toronto Metropolitan University. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted using an interview guide focusing on how participants searched for, assessed, and applied information on new drugs to their practice. Approximately 7.5 hours of interview recordings were transcribed into 132 pages. Data were anonymized and coded in NVivo-12. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.<br/>
<br/>
<b>RESULTS:</b>  
Three main findings were revealed from the themes. First, physicians' information-seeking behaviors differ between the point of care and out-of-practice settings. At the point of care, they prefer quickly accessible sources like medical websites and apps due to time constraints. In contrast, outside of practice, they tend to consult primary literature, journal articles, or their professional networks for more in-depth information. Second, physicians seldom conduct their own appraisals of new information. Instead, they rely on pre-appraised sources and their professional networks to obtain critically assessed information. Finally, when applying new information to clinical decision-making for drug prescriptions, physicians largely depend on expert opinions from specialists, senior colleagues, and experienced pharmacists. <br/>

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>  
The study has contributed to the current knowledge of physicians’ evidence-based decision-making for drug prescriptions by shedding light on physicians' point of care and out-of-practice information-seeking, appraisal, and use practices. Based on the study findings it can be suggested that at the point of care, using medical information systems that offer instant access to summarized, trustworthy evidence and the ability to connect with communities of practice in real-time can be an effective strategy to enhance physicians' evidence-based practices when prescribing new drugs.<br/>
