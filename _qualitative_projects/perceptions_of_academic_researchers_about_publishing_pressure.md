title: "Perceptions of Academic Researchers About Publishing Pressure: A Thematic Analysis"
excerpt: "This study investigates the perceptions of UK academic researchers about the pressures of publishing in scientific journals. Using qualitative interviews from various career stages, it identifies key themes like funding, competition, impact factor, career progression, recognition, personality, and institutional factors. The findings highlight the complexities of publishing pressure and suggest the need for strategies to support researchers in managing these challenges.<br/>"

<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
In recent years, the number of scientific articles and papers publishing in different journals has changed dramatically along with the change in the trend of journal publishing culture. Researchers sometimes experience the pressure of publishing which can be attributed to several factors including the competition among scientists to publish in the higher ranking journals, career progression in their field of study. The purpose of this study is to understand the perceptions of the researchers on the publishing pressure through their own experiences. Our main focus is academic researchers from different fields who are affiliated with different universities in the United Kingdom. This study is intended to add to the current knowledge of researchers’ publishing attitudes and behavior by exploring the similarities and differences between the perceived thoughts of researchers on publishing pressure.

<b>METHODS:</b>  
Qualitative semi-structured interviews of academic researchers were collected from “Figshare”, which is an open-access data repository. The interviewees ranged from Ph.D. students to senior professors in their career position. The interviews started with the narration of the respondents on their decision of choosing “scientist or researcher” as a profession, which then focused on their academic career and publishing practices, their perception of publishing pressure, and finally ended with their thoughts on Open Access publishing. Data were analyzed with an inductive content analysis approach in NVivo-12.

<b>RESULTS:</b>  
Seven themes were identified and the inter-rater reliability coefficient was satisfactory for all the themes (Cohen’s Kappa > 0.7). All the themes were common and vividly presented in the narration of the three participants as they recounted their academic and professional careers and perceived the change in publication trend and culture along with the publishing pressure either from their own experience or through others surrounding them. The themes are (in the order of most frequent occurrences)- Funding, Competition, Impact Factor, Career Progression, Recognition, Personality, Institutional Factor.

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>  
The study has contributed to the current knowledge on researchers’ perceptions about the publishing pressure by highlighting the current trend, identifying the influencing factors, and demonstrating the role of institutions in the publishing practice of the researchers. Further research on this matter might help the academics and institutions to develop interventions or make policy changes to protect the researchers from undue and unhealthy publishing pressure.
