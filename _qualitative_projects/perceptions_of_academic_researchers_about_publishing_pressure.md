title: "Perceptions of Academic Researchers About Publishing Pressure: A Thematic Analysis"
excerpt: "This study investigates the perceptions of UK academic researchers about the pressures of publishing in scientific journals. Using qualitative interviews from various career stages, it identifies key themes like funding, competition, impact factor, career progression, recognition, personality, and institutional factors. The findings highlight the complexities of publishing pressure and suggest the need for strategies to support researchers in managing these challenges.<br/>"

<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
In recent years, the number of scientific articles and papers published in different journals has changed dramatically along with the change in the trend of journal publishing culture, which is partly attributed to competition among scientists to publish in higher-ranking journals (Anderson et al., 2007). Researchers sometimes experience the pressure of publishing in terms of the number of papers they are publishing, the ranking of the journal they can publish into, the H-index or the impact factor of the journal, and even the career progression in their field of study (Tijdink et al., 2016). The same study by Tijdink et al. (2016) showed that although the intensity of the pressure might differ according to the position and area of research of the researchers, it still exists throughout most of the disciplines and levels of research engagement be it in Ph.D., post-doctoral, or assigned academic affiliation as a faculty member. Publication pressure can lead to negative consequences among scientists. One study has shown that there is an association between publication pressure and burnout of the researchers (Tijdink et al., 2013), while another study suggested that pressure to publish papers sometimes leads to scientific misconduct, which has increased over the last decade (Tijdink et al., 2014). Most of the studies that investigated the publication trend and publication pressure were quantitative in nature and explored the factors associated with this topic objectively (Van Dalen & Henkens, 2012). The purpose of this study is to understand the perceptions of the researchers on the publishing pressure through their own experiences.  

<b>METHODS:</b>  
Data from qualitative semi-structured interviews of academic researchers were collected secondarily from “Figshare”, which is an open-access data repository. Data were anonymous and data description was provided along with the interview transcripts by the data distributor (Bowley, 2015). The interviewees ranged from Ph.D. students to senior professors in their career positions. The interviews started with the narration of the respondents on their decision to choose “scientist or researcher” as a profession, which then focused on their academic career and publishing practices, their perception of publishing pressure, and finally ended with their thoughts on Open Access publishing. I have analyzed three interview transcripts of three researchers identified as p1, p2, and p3 in this study who were working at two different universities in Chemistry, Biology, and Environmental Science respectively during the interviews.

Data were analyzed with an inductive content analysis approach. At first, I read through the transcripts and pointed out the repetitively occurring themes, which were then listed in NVivo. A list of themes along with the theme definitions (Table 1) and 20% of my data that consisted of all the possible themes was shared with a second independent rater. Then, both of us coded the themes independently according to their definitions and concepts and compared our codes using NVivo. After rounds of discussions, we ruled out the differences in our understanding of the themes and finally re-run the inter-rater reliability coefficient and it was satisfactory for all the themes (Cohen’s Kappa > 0.7). After that, I coded the rest of the data into the selected themes. Seven major themes have emerged in this process.

<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:</b></br>
Seven themes were identified and the inter-rater reliability coefficient was satisfactory for all the themes (Cohen’s Kappa > 0.7). All the themes were common and vividly presented in the narration of the three participants as they recounted their academic and professional careers and perceived the change in publication trends and culture along with the publishing pressure either from their own experience or through others surrounding them. The themes are (in the order of most frequent occurrences)- Funding, Competition, Impact Factor, Career Progression, Recognition, Personality, and Institutional Factor (Figure 1).

Despite having different fields of research and different work settings, all of the participants mentioned in this study had a similar perception of the current publishing culture, which is more focused on getting funds,
having high-impact journal publications, high citations, wide recognition, and last but not least securing a bright career as well-demonstrated by the emerging themes from the descriptions. P1 has described the trend vividly by stating - “_I think nowadays people are a lot more clued upon to a lot of things for example how important it is getting funding, getting your publications in the highest impact journals, trying to get citations, making sure you do cite yourself a little bit, so then those other people will then cite you so you can get your h-index higher and so on._” 
<p>

Apart from delineating the publishing trend, the study has identified several factors that respondents perceive as push agents for their paper publications. For example, the feeling of competitiveness among peers, colleagues, and other researchers from the same field somewhat impels researchers to publish more, which in most cases is considered as a positive drive although its negative impact cannot be overlooked completely. When P2 was asked about the same, a feeling of disappointment became evident -“_It saddens me to a degree. I don't think there's a utopia out there where everyone can do science and everybody's happy and no one feels competitive pressure or jealous of their colleagues who may be doing slightly better than them._” Amongst the other factors identified from the themes that influence the publishing behavior of the researchers and make them feel the pressure are career progression, funding bodies, recognition in the specific field, and self-drive. 
</p>

Another interesting finding of this study is the role of institutions in the publishing career of academic researchers. The respondents had varying perceptions about the influence of their departments and institutions in their research careers. While P1 justified the push from the institution to publish as a positive force to improve the productivity of its staff, P2 argued on the role of universities in pressurizing publications to maintain their reputation and questioned its role for not acknowledging other activities researchers do in their institutions other than research, by stating - “_I think a place like (university) should have the
self-confidence to say, 'Look, we know we're a world-class institution and we may have relied a bit too much on impact factors in the past and here's what we're going to do in the future, because we really value the people that come and work here. And we really value all the different things that they do, we value their research, we value their teaching, we value their contributions to college life, we value their public engagement activities….But at the moment research is still seen as the be-all and end-all, so there is a distortion. And that distortion bleeds through to publishing practices._”</br>

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>  
The study has several limitations. The number of interview transcripts analyzed was very small, only for three respondents which can be a cause of the small number of themes identified. Analyzing data for more respondents could contribute to the emergence of a wider array of themes. Additionally, because of the small number of data, it was not possible to identify any predominant modifiers for the main themes. Finally, all of the respondents in the data were professors in the ranking, which failed to give insight into other academic levels like graduate, Ph.D., or post-doctoral fellows.

However, despite the limitations, the study has contributed to the current knowledge on researchers’ perceptions about the publishing pressure by highlighting the current trend, identifying the influencing factors, and demonstrating the role of institutions in the publishing practice of the researchers. Further research on this matter might help the academics and institutions to develop interventions or make policy changes to protect the researchers from undue and unhealthy publishing pressure.
