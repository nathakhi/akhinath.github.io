title: "Attitudes Towards Telemedicine During COVID-19 and Intention to Use after the Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study"
excerpt: "This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on telemedicine use, patient satisfaction, and future intention to use. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to understand attitudes toward telemedicine, its usage frequency, satisfaction levels, and intentions for future use. Results showed that 85.7% of respondents used telemedicine during the pandemic, with most finding it convenient and time-saving. However, concerns about the quality of care were noted by 50% of participants. Despite this, nearly 90% reported satisfaction with telemedicine services, and many indicated they would continue using it in the future. The study highlights the potential for telemedicine to remain a key healthcare delivery method post-pandemic.<br/>

<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
Telemedicine is a term in healthcare that refers to the use of information and communication technologies to deliver healthcare services remotely, without face-to-face interaction between healthcare providers and patients (Grigsby et al., 1995). These services typically include audio or video consultations, text messaging, and sharing of radiological images or other medical information between patients and physicians (Klaassen et al., 2016). While telemedicine was introduced around 50 years ago, it has evolved with advances in technology. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has placed telemedicine at the forefront of healthcare delivery worldwide (Ahmed et al., 2020).

The benefits of telemedicine include: (i) providing remote consultations for patients who could not easily reach healthcare professionals, (ii) being cost-effective by reducing travel and other related expenses, and (iii) offering convenience by eliminating physical wait times for consultations. During the pandemic, telemedicine's advantages expanded to include reducing infection rates by limiting hospital and clinic visits, while still allowing for timely and safe patient care. At the onset of the pandemic, when hospitals, clinics, and healthcare professionals were overwhelmed by the surge in patient numbers, telemedicine played a crucial role in curbing infections while maintaining essential healthcare services. It allowed healthcare providers to minimize in-person visits, screen suspected COVID-19 patients remotely, and offer remote consultations to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children, thereby reducing their risk of exposure (Smith et al., 2020). Before the pandemic, telemedicine was growing slowly, but its use became much more prominent as the pandemic progressed (Ahmed et al., 2020). Experts believe that the shift from in-person consultations to teleconsultations will have a lasting impact on the healthcare delivery system, even after the pandemic ends (Ramaswamy et al., 2020).

Several studies have examined the patterns of telemedicine use and patient satisfaction among specific populations using telehealth services provided by hospitals, organizations, or other practice settings. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a few studies have explored trends in virtual care and patient satisfaction among users of specific telemedicine services. However, questions remain about how this shift to virtual consultations is influencing people's treatment-seeking behavior and whether these effects will persist after the pandemic, as some have predicted. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate people's attitudes toward telemedicine and whether it will influence their intention to use telemedicine after the pandemic through a cross-sectional survey.

<b>METHODS:</b>  
This is a descriptive cross-sectional study aiming at understanding peoples’ attitudes toward telemedicine use and their intention to use this remote mode of healthcare in the future. For this study, a survey instrument was developed with 12 questions on demographic information, attitude to telemedicine, frequency of using telemedicine services, satisfaction level (if used), and intention for future use along with two open-ended questions. For demographic information, I have included age groups, gender, and level of education to observe any variation in the attitudes or preferences for telemedicine among people depending on these variables. There are two multiple-choice questions to determine the frequency and mode of telemedicine services used by the respondents. Five Forced-choice questions in the survey aimed at determining the attitudes and satisfaction level of respondents for the teleconsultation services during the pandemic using 5 5-point Likert scale. Forced-choice questions include a comparison of the wait time and duration of consultation between in-person and remotely; the extent of agreement to different aspects of the teleconsultation in terms of saving time, reducing costs, convenience of use, comfort for sharing problems, confidence in treatment received, and concern regarding maintenance of privacy while using telemedicine services using a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly disagree and 5 = Strongly agree). Two questions on the level of satisfaction with the quality of treatment received and the mode of consultation delivery were included in the survey to examine whether attitudes are influenced by the satisfaction level of the users. The two open-ended questions are expected to provide a better understanding of the patients’ experience of using telemedicine that might influence their attitude as well as the possible reason for the future unusability of telehealth services. The variation of questions will help to capture different aspects of the user’s behaviors, actions, and feelings that will give a wider lens to understand the actual attitudes of respondents towards the use of telemedicine services.

<b>Data Collection:</b> The survey instrument was peer-reviewed for content validity by two group members who were not part of the study. For the pilot survey, I have used a convenience sampling technique. Respondents for the pilot survey are from the same institution as the researcher and there is no personal relationship between the researcher and the respondents. An active link to the survey was shared in a discussion forum and respondents were invited to participate in the survey voluntarily through their institutional email addresses. Institutional Research Ethics Board exemption was obtained before the pilot survey. It took around 48 hours to collect the responses from seven participants. Respondents were adults from different age groups between 18 and 64 years. Four of them are male and three are female. All of the participants have education levels up to University.

<b>Data Analysis:</b> Data were analyzed in the SPSS using descriptive statistics to show the distribution of the demographic characteristics of the respondents, the relation between different variables (frequency of use of telemedicine, attitudes to telemedicine, satisfaction level, and intentions to use in future) by crosstabulation to see whether and how the attitude can be influenced by other variables. The answers to the open-ended questions were analyzed through narrative analysis to explore the common thoughts of the respondents delineating their attitudes toward the future use of telemedicine.

<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:</b>  

<b>Quantitative Analysis:</b> The data for the seven respondents were coded into the SPSS and the descriptive statistics were performed for the demographic variables first. Among the participants, most were equally distributed to three age groups (28.6% for each group of 18-24, 25-34, 35-44 years of age) and only 14.3% were from the age group of 55-64 years (Figure 1). <br/>

While all of the respondents were in the University education group in terms of the level of education, 57.1% of them were male and 42.9% were female. Around 85.7% said that they used telemedicine service at least once during this pandemic and the frequency of use did not vary much by gender (Figure 2). <br/>

Among the platforms used for receiving telemedicine care, the most common was the telephone (57.14%) followed by video conferencing through Zoom or Google Meet)(Figure 3). <br/>

Though there are variations in responses for comparing the wait time and duration of teleconsultation with face-to-face consultation, the highest percentage (42.9%) of respondents found it the same as in-person. Six items were used to measure the attitude of the respondents toward telemedicine by indicating their level of agreement with statements on whether telemedicine saves time, reduces travel costs, convenient to use, is comfortable sharing problems, provides quality treatment, and whether they are concerned about their privacy. The findings showed that most of the participants agreed on the first five components and disagreed about the privacy concern which implies that most of them have a positive attitude toward telemedicine services. Moreover, those who had positive attitudes also expressed their intention to use telemedicine in the future (Tables 1 and 2). <br/>

Table 3 shows that respondents were either somewhat or very satisfied with the treatment through telemedicine, though their satisfaction level does not indicate their intention to future use of the service. Chi-square tests were computed for the cross-tabulations to see the association between the variables mentioned above which were found to be insignificant in almost all cases failing to show any association. However, as the Chi-square test is sensitive to sample size, it might not produce a statistically significant relationship between variables specifically for the small-n sample. <br/>

<b>Qualitative Analysis:</b> The answers from the open-ended questions provided more insight into the respondents’ experiences with telemedicine and factors that could act as barriers to the future usability of telemedicine. Overall, the experiences of the users were positive. Several benefits of telemedicine were identified repeatedly from their experiences, for example, one respondent mentioned ​“_I found the experience to be convenient and quite comforting_”, while another respondent was content not to travel for consultation - ​“_and I appreciated not having to go into the doctor’s office_.” A few other advantages of telemedicine were pointed out by the respondents in terms of efficiency, satisfaction with the treatment they received, and easy communication, all of which might explain the reasoning behind their positive attitude. However, two respondents highlighted an important aspect of using telemedicine. According to them, the current use of telemedicine might not be very unpleasant, still, they would prefer to attend consultation physically to discuss their problems in detail. For the second question (What kind of issues/difficulties do you believe can deter you from using telemedicine services in the future?), the most common issue identified was the concern about the inaccuracy of
diagnosis as physicians would not be able to do a complete examination during teleconsultation.
“_If the problem you are facing requires the doctor to physically touch or examine the body, telemedicine may cause a faulty or inaccurate diagnosis_”.<br/>

Among the other barriers to the future use of telemedicine are difficulty in scheduling due to wait time or technological problems, unavailability of all necessary medications online, and difficulty in conveying information.

Responses from most of the questions added to the understanding of the attitude and perception of the respondents toward telemedicine and their intention to pursue it in the future. The most significant findings of the study were i) increased use of telemedicine during this pandemic is evident by six users in contrast to only one non-user irrespective of age group and gender ii) the exploration of attitudes of the respondents which were close to the expectation being more towards positive for the mentioned aspects of telemedicine iii) positive relationship between the attitude and future intention to use telemedicine (Tables 1 and 2) which implies that those with positive attitudes have the more intention to continue teleconsultation after the pandemic. The narrative analysis of the open-ended questions supports the findings from the statistical analysis through respondents’ positive experiences of using telemedicine.

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>  
There are several limitations to this study. As the sample size is very small and collected through convenience sampling to pilot the study, it might not be representative of the original population. Additionally, the number of questions is limited to answer the research question. Few of the questions did not add much to the information required to answer the research question, for instance, the comparison between teleconsultation and face-to-face consultation in terms of wait time for appointments or duration of consultation; satisfaction with the platform used for teleconsultation; intention to recommend telemedicine to others in future. These questions will be removed or refined for future deployment of an effective survey to measure the attitude and perception of the users and non-users of telemedicine.

Despite several limitations, this study has been able to provide important insights into the current use trend of telemedicine, its perceived usefulness, people’s attitudes and perceptions of telecommunication with their healthcare providers, the likeliness of teleconsultation being durable and preferable in the future, and factors that could affect that possibility. With the constant advancement of technology in healthcare more and more studies should focus on the remote mode of healthcare deliveries as pandemics like COVID-19 might not be the last one and identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the use of remote consultation by studying the people’s attitudes and perceptions might provide the scope to develop right interventions at right time.
