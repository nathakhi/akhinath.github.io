title: "A Cross-sectional Survey on the Attitudes Towards Telemedicine During COVID-19 and Intention to Use after the Pandemic"
excerpt: "This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on telemedicine use, patient satisfaction, and future intentions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to understand attitudes toward telemedicine, its usage frequency, satisfaction levels, and intentions for future use. Results showed that 85.7% of respondents used telemedicine during the pandemic, with most finding it convenient and time-saving. However, concerns about the quality of care were noted by 50% of participants. Despite this, nearly 90% reported satisfaction with telemedicine services, and many indicated they would continue using it in the future. The study highlights the potential for telemedicine to remain a key healthcare method post-pandemic.<br/>

<b>BACKGROUND:</b>  
There have been several studies in the past that investigated the patterns of telemedicine use, patient satisfaction among specific populations using specific telehealth services provided by the hospitals, organizations, or other practice settings. Since the beginning of the pandemic, few studies have been conducted to determine the trend of virtual care and patients’ satisfaction who have used specific telemedicine services. However, how this change in consultation method being mostly remote and virtual, is affecting people’s treatment-seeking behavior and whether the effect is going to last longer even after the pandemic ends as is predicted by some, these questions are yet to be explored. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the attitudes of people regarding telemedicine use and whether it affects the intention to use telemedicine after the pandemic through a cross-sectional survey.

<b>METHODS:</b>  
This is a descriptive cross-sectional study aiming at understanding peoples’ attitudes toward telemedicine use and their intention to use this remote mode of healthcare in the future. For this study, a survey instrument was developed with 12 questions including demographic information, attitude to telemedicine, frequency of using telemedicine services, and satisfaction level (if used), and intention for future use along with two open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using SPSS and NVivo (for responses from open-ended questions).

<b>RESULTS:</b>  
Around 85.7% said that they used telemedicine service at least once during this pandemic. Among the platforms used for receiving telemedicine care, the most common was the telephone (57.14%) followed by video conferencing through Zoom or Google Meet). More than 70% of respondents agreed that telemedicine saves time, reduces travel time, convenient, feels comfortable discussing their problems during teleconsultation, and not very concerned about privacy breaches. However, 50% of the respondents were not confident about the quality of the treatment through telemedicine. Nearly 90% of those who used telemedicine indicated at least some degree of satisfaction and those who had positive attitudes also expressed their intention to use telemedicine in the future.

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>  
This study has been able to provide an important insight into the current use trend of telemedicine, its perceived usefulness, people’s attitudes and perceptions of telecommunication with their healthcare providers, the likeliness of teleconsultation being durable and preferable in future, and factors that could affect that possibility. With the constant advancement of technology in healthcare more and more studies should focus on the remote mode of healthcare deliveries as pandemic like COVID-19 might not be the last one and identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the use of remote consultation by studying the people’s attitudes and perceptions might provide the scope to develop right interventions at right time.
